A collection of nodes to interact with the IBM Watson services in [IBM Bluemix](http://bluemix.net).

# Nodes

- Language Identification
    - Detects the language used in text
- Natural Language Classifier
    - Uses machine learning algorithms to return the top matching predefined classes for short text inputs.
- Personality Insights
    - Use linguistic analytics to infer cognitive and social characteristics from text
- Relationship Extraction
    - Extract entities and their relationships from unstructured text
- Speech To Text
    - Convert audio containing speech to text
- Language Translation
    - Translates text from one language to another
- Text To Speech
    - Convert text to audio speech
- Tone Analyzer
    - Discover, understand, and revise the language tones in text.
- Tradeoff Analytics
    - Optimize decisions balance between multiple conflicting objectives.
- Visual Recognition
    - Analyze visual appearance of images to understand their contents
- Feature Extract
    - Analyse a single piece of text content (either public URL, HTML or raw text)
      to extract multiple AlchemyAPI detected features, e.g. entities, keywords,
      sentiment.
- Image Analysis
    - Upload an image to detect either faces, URL text or
      content present in the image.
- Dialog
    - Automate branching conversation between a user and your application.
    - Use natural language to automatically respond to user questions, cross-sell and up-sell, walk users through processes or applications, or even hand-hold users through difficult tasks.
